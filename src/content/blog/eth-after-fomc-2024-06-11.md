## Event Snapshot

- Event: **FOMC**
- Asset: **ETH**
- Event date: **2024-06-11**
- As-of date (T-1): **2026-03-08**
- Freshness age: **635 days**
- Sample size (all-history): **23**

## Event Outcome

- FOMC Outcome: **FLAT** (Actual 5.5, Previous 5.5, Delta +0.0000)
- Direction basis: **vs_previous**

## Probability Table (All-history)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 43.48% | 56.52% | -0.1% | 0.91% | 23 |
| T+7 | 30.43% | 69.57% | -3.26% | -2.8% | 23 |

## Probability Table (Same-direction)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 35.29% | 64.71% | -1.41% | 0.94% | 17 |
| T+7 | 29.41% | 70.59% | -3.26% | -1.88% | 17 |

## Historical Distribution Summary

When FOMC was **FLAT**, ETH T+1 up probability was **35.29%** (n=17).

When FOMC was **FLAT**, ETH T+7 up probability was **29.41%** (n=17).

Same-direction T+7 median return: **-3.26%**.

For ETH, historical FOMC windows show all-history T+1 up probability of 43.48% and T+7 up probability of 30.43%. When FOMC printed Flat versus previous, T+1 up probability was 35.29% and T+7 up probability was 29.41% across 17 matched cases. Current classification is Bearish; this remains an educational probability lens, not investment advice.

## Methodology

This page aggregates historical windows for the same event type (FOMC) and deduplicates by event date. It reports both all-history probabilities and same-direction probabilities based on event outcome direction (vs previous) for educational use only.
