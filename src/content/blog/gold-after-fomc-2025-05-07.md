## Probability Table (All-history)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 69.57% | 30.43% | 0.34% | 0.24% | 23 |
| T+7 | 56.52% | 43.48% | 0.9% | 0.05% | 23 |

## Probability Table (Same-direction)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 70.59% | 29.41% | 0.32% | 0.31% | 17 |
| T+7 | 52.94% | 47.06% | 0.15% | -0.16% | 17 |

## Historical Distribution Summary

When FOMC was **FLAT**, GOLD T+1 up probability was **70.59%** (n=17).

When FOMC was **FLAT**, GOLD T+7 up probability was **52.94%** (n=17).

Same-direction T+7 median return: **0.15%**.

For GOLD, historical FOMC windows show all-history T+1 up probability of 69.57% and T+7 up probability of 56.52%. When FOMC printed Flat versus previous, T+1 up probability was 70.59% and T+7 up probability was 52.94% across 17 matched cases. Current classification is Bullish; this remains an educational probability lens, not investment advice.

## Methodology

This page aggregates historical windows for the same event type (FOMC) and deduplicates by event date. It reports both all-history probabilities and same-direction probabilities based on event outcome direction (vs previous) for educational use only.
