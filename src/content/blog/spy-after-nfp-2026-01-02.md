## Event Snapshot

- Event: **NFP**
- Asset: **SPY**
- Event date: **2026-01-02**
- As-of date (T-1): **2026-03-05**
- Freshness age: **62 days**
- Sample size (all-history): **13**

## Event Outcome

- NFP Outcome: **UP** (Actual 158627.0, Previous 158497.0, Delta +130.0000)
- Direction basis: **vs_previous**

## Probability Table (All-history)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 0.0% | 100.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0 |
| T+7 | 76.92% | 23.08% | 1.39% | 1.41% | 13 |

## Probability Table (Same-direction)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 0.0% | 100.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0 |
| T+7 | 75.0% | 25.0% | 1.27% | 1.28% | 12 |

## Historical Distribution Summary

When NFP was **UP**, SPY T+1 up probability was **0.0%** (n=0).

When NFP was **UP**, SPY T+7 up probability was **75.0%** (n=12).

Same-direction T+7 median return: **1.27%**.

For SPY, historical NFP windows show all-history T+1 up probability of 0.0% and T+7 up probability of 76.92%. When NFP printed Up versus previous, T+1 up probability was 0.0% and T+7 up probability was 75.0% across 0 matched cases. Current classification is Neutral; this remains an educational probability lens, not investment advice.

## Methodology

This page aggregates historical windows for the same event type (NFP) and deduplicates by event date. It reports both all-history probabilities and same-direction probabilities based on event outcome direction (vs previous) for educational use only.
