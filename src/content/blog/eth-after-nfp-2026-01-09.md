## Event Snapshot

- Event: **NFP**
- Asset: **ETH**
- Event date: **2026-01-09**
- As-of date (T-1): **2026-03-03**
- Freshness age: **53 days**
- Sample size (all-history): **34**

## Event Outcome

- NFP Outcome: **UP** (Actual 158627.0, Previous 158497.0, Delta +130.0000)
- Direction basis: **vs_previous**

## Probability Table (All-history)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 50.0% | 50.0% | 0.0% | -0.15% | 34 |
| T+7 | 55.88% | 44.12% | 1.44% | 2.65% | 34 |

## Probability Table (Same-direction)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 50.0% | 50.0% | 0.0% | -0.14% | 30 |
| T+7 | 53.33% | 46.67% | 0.79% | 2.65% | 30 |

## Historical Distribution Summary

When NFP was **UP**, ETH T+1 up probability was **50.0%** (n=30).

When NFP was **UP**, ETH T+7 up probability was **53.33%** (n=30).

Same-direction T+7 median return: **0.79%**.

For ETH, historical NFP windows show all-history T+1 up probability of 50.0% and T+7 up probability of 55.88%. When NFP printed Up versus previous, T+1 up probability was 50.0% and T+7 up probability was 53.33% across 30 matched cases. Current classification is Neutral; this remains an educational probability lens, not investment advice.

## Methodology

This page aggregates historical windows for the same event type (NFP) and deduplicates by event date. It reports both all-history probabilities and same-direction probabilities based on event outcome direction (vs previous) for educational use only.
