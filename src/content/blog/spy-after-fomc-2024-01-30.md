## Probability Table (All-history)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 52.17% | 47.83% | 0.1% | -0.02% | 23 |
| T+7 | 56.52% | 43.48% | 0.54% | 0.26% | 23 |

## Probability Table (Same-direction)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 47.06% | 52.94% | -0.2% | -0.08% | 17 |
| T+7 | 64.71% | 35.29% | 0.57% | 0.48% | 17 |

## Historical Distribution Summary

When FOMC was **FLAT**, SPY T+1 up probability was **47.06%** (n=17).

When FOMC was **FLAT**, SPY T+7 up probability was **64.71%** (n=17).

Same-direction T+7 median return: **0.57%**.

For SPY, historical FOMC windows show all-history T+1 up probability of 52.17% and T+7 up probability of 56.52%. When FOMC printed Flat versus previous, T+1 up probability was 47.06% and T+7 up probability was 64.71% across 17 matched cases. Current classification is Neutral; this remains an educational probability lens, not investment advice.

## Methodology

This page aggregates historical windows for the same event type (FOMC) and deduplicates by event date. It reports both all-history probabilities and same-direction probabilities based on event outcome direction (vs previous) for educational use only.
