## Probability Table (All-history)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 57.14% | 42.86% | 0.35% | 0.28% | 14 |
| T+7 | 53.85% | 46.15% | 0.6% | 0.54% | 13 |

## Probability Table (Same-direction)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 53.85% | 46.15% | 0.16% | 0.26% | 13 |
| T+7 | 53.85% | 46.15% | 0.6% | 0.54% | 13 |

## Historical Distribution Summary

When CPI was **UP**, QQQ T+1 up probability was **53.85%** (n=13).

When CPI was **UP**, QQQ T+7 up probability was **53.85%** (n=13).

Same-direction T+7 median return: **0.6%**.

For QQQ, historical CPI windows show all-history T+1 up probability of 57.14% and T+7 up probability of 53.85%. When CPI printed Up versus previous, T+1 up probability was 53.85% and T+7 up probability was 53.85% across 13 matched cases. Current classification is Neutral; this remains an educational probability lens, not investment advice.

## Methodology

This page aggregates historical windows for the same event type (CPI) and deduplicates by event date. It reports both all-history probabilities and same-direction probabilities based on event outcome direction (vs previous) for educational use only.
