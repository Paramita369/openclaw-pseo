## Event Snapshot

- Event: **CPI**
- Asset: **QQQ**
- Event date: **2024-06-12**
- As-of date (T-1): **2026-03-05**
- Freshness age: **631 days**
- Sample size (all-history): **14**

## Event Outcome

- CPI Outcome: **DOWN** (Actual 313.044, Previous 313.175, Delta -0.1310)
- Direction basis: **vs_previous**

## Probability Table (All-history)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 57.14% | 42.86% | 0.35% | 0.28% | 14 |
| T+7 | 53.85% | 46.15% | 0.6% | 0.54% | 13 |

## Probability Table (Same-direction)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 100.0% | 0.0% | 0.54% | 0.54% | 1 |
| T+7 | 0.0% | 100.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0 |

## Historical Distribution Summary

When CPI was **DOWN**, QQQ T+1 up probability was **100.0%** (n=1).

When CPI was **DOWN**, QQQ T+7 up probability was **0.0%** (n=0).

Same-direction T+7 median return: **0.0%**.

For QQQ, historical CPI windows show all-history T+1 up probability of 57.14% and T+7 up probability of 53.85%. When CPI printed Down versus previous, T+1 up probability was 100.0% and T+7 up probability was 0.0% across 0 matched cases. Current classification is Neutral; this remains an educational probability lens, not investment advice.

## Methodology

This page aggregates historical windows for the same event type (CPI) and deduplicates by event date. It reports both all-history probabilities and same-direction probabilities based on event outcome direction (vs previous) for educational use only.
