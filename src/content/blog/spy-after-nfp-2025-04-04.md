## Probability Table (All-history)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 47.62% | 52.38% | -0.04% | -0.1% | 21 |
| T+7 | 55.88% | 44.12% | 0.11% | 0.81% | 34 |

## Probability Table (Same-direction)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 38.89% | 61.11% | -0.13% | -0.22% | 18 |
| T+7 | 56.67% | 43.33% | 0.11% | 0.83% | 30 |

## Historical Distribution Summary

When NFP was **UP**, SPY T+1 up probability was **38.89%** (n=18).

When NFP was **UP**, SPY T+7 up probability was **56.67%** (n=30).

Same-direction T+7 median return: **0.11%**.

For SPY, historical NFP windows show all-history T+1 up probability of 47.62% and T+7 up probability of 55.88%. When NFP printed Up versus previous, T+1 up probability was 38.89% and T+7 up probability was 56.67% across 18 matched cases. Current classification is Neutral; this remains an educational probability lens, not investment advice.

## Methodology

This page aggregates historical windows for the same event type (NFP) and deduplicates by event date. It reports both all-history probabilities and same-direction probabilities based on event outcome direction (vs previous) for educational use only.
