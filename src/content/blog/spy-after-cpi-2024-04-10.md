## Event Snapshot

- Event: **CPI**
- Asset: **SPY**
- Event date: **2024-04-10**
- As-of date (T-1): **2026-03-11**
- Freshness age: **700 days**
- Sample size (all-history): **39**

## Event Outcome

- CPI Outcome: **UP** (Actual 313.023, Previous 312.345, Delta +0.6780)
- Direction basis: **vs_previous**

## Probability Table (All-history)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 64.1% | 35.9% | 0.16% | 0.21% | 39 |
| T+7 | 68.42% | 31.58% | 0.51% | 0.21% | 38 |

## Probability Table (Same-direction)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 63.16% | 36.84% | 0.14% | 0.21% | 38 |
| T+7 | 68.42% | 31.58% | 0.51% | 0.21% | 38 |

## Historical Distribution Summary

When CPI was **UP**, SPY T+1 up probability was **63.16%** (n=38).

When CPI was **UP**, SPY T+7 up probability was **68.42%** (n=38).

Same-direction T+7 median return: **0.51%**.

For SPY, historical CPI windows show all-history T+1 up probability of 64.1% and T+7 up probability of 68.42%. When CPI printed Up versus previous, T+1 up probability was 63.16% and T+7 up probability was 68.42% across 38 matched cases. Current classification is Bullish; this remains an educational probability lens, not investment advice.

## Methodology

This page aggregates historical windows for the same event type (CPI) and deduplicates by event date. It reports both all-history probabilities and same-direction probabilities based on event outcome direction (vs previous) for educational use only.
