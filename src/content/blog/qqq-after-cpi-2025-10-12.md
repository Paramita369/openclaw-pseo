- As-of date (T-1): **2026-03-05**
- Freshness age: **144 days**
- Sample size (all-history): **39**

## Probability Table (All-history)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 61.54% | 38.46% | 0.21% | 0.23% | 39 |
| T+7 | 55.26% | 44.74% | 0.58% | 0.2% | 38 |

## Probability Table (Same-direction)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 60.53% | 39.47% | 0.19% | 0.23% | 38 |
| T+7 | 55.26% | 44.74% | 0.58% | 0.2% | 38 |

## Historical Distribution Summary

When CPI was **UP**, QQQ T+1 up probability was **60.53%** (n=38).

When CPI was **UP**, QQQ T+7 up probability was **55.26%** (n=38).

Same-direction T+7 median return: **0.58%**.

For QQQ, historical CPI windows show all-history T+1 up probability of 61.54% and T+7 up probability of 55.26%. When CPI printed Up versus previous, T+1 up probability was 60.53% and T+7 up probability was 55.26% across 38 matched cases. Current classification is Bullish; this remains an educational probability lens, not investment advice.

## Methodology

This page aggregates historical windows for the same event type (CPI) and deduplicates by event date. It reports both all-history probabilities and same-direction probabilities based on event outcome direction (vs previous) for educational use only.
