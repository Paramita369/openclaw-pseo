## Probability Table (All-history)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 64.29% | 35.71% | 0.15% | 0.26% | 14 |
| T+7 | 76.92% | 23.08% | 1.08% | 0.51% | 13 |

## Probability Table (Same-direction)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 61.54% | 38.46% | 0.09% | 0.26% | 13 |
| T+7 | 76.92% | 23.08% | 1.08% | 0.51% | 13 |

## Historical Distribution Summary

When CPI was **UP**, SPY T+1 up probability was **61.54%** (n=13).

When CPI was **UP**, SPY T+7 up probability was **76.92%** (n=13).

Same-direction T+7 median return: **1.08%**.

For SPY, historical CPI windows show all-history T+1 up probability of 64.29% and T+7 up probability of 76.92%. When CPI printed Up versus previous, T+1 up probability was 61.54% and T+7 up probability was 76.92% across 13 matched cases. Current classification is Bullish; this remains an educational probability lens, not investment advice.

## Methodology

This page aggregates historical windows for the same event type (CPI) and deduplicates by event date. It reports both all-history probabilities and same-direction probabilities based on event outcome direction (vs previous) for educational use only.
