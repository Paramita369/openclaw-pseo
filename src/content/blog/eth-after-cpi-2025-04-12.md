## Event Snapshot

- Event: **CPI**
- Asset: **ETH**
- Event date: **2025-04-12**
- As-of date (T-1): **2026-03-05**
- Freshness age: **327 days**
- Sample size (all-history): **39**

## Event Outcome

- CPI Outcome: **UP** (Actual 320.302, Previous 319.785, Delta +0.5170)
- Direction basis: **vs_previous**

## Probability Table (All-history)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 58.97% | 41.03% | 0.94% | 0.55% | 39 |
| T+7 | 43.59% | 56.41% | -1.18% | 0.23% | 39 |

## Probability Table (Same-direction)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 60.53% | 39.47% | 0.96% | 0.64% | 38 |
| T+7 | 44.74% | 55.26% | -1.52% | 0.24% | 38 |

## Historical Distribution Summary

When CPI was **UP**, ETH T+1 up probability was **60.53%** (n=38).

When CPI was **UP**, ETH T+7 up probability was **44.74%** (n=38).

Same-direction T+7 median return: **-1.52%**.

For ETH, historical CPI windows show all-history T+1 up probability of 58.97% and T+7 up probability of 43.59%. When CPI printed Up versus previous, T+1 up probability was 60.53% and T+7 up probability was 44.74% across 38 matched cases. Current classification is Neutral; this remains an educational probability lens, not investment advice.

## Methodology

This page aggregates historical windows for the same event type (CPI) and deduplicates by event date. It reports both all-history probabilities and same-direction probabilities based on event outcome direction (vs previous) for educational use only.
