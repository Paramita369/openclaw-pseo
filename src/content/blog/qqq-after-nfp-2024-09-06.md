## Event Snapshot

- Event: **NFP**
- Asset: **QQQ**
- Event date: **2024-09-06**
- As-of date (T-1): **2026-03-11**
- Freshness age: **551 days**
- Sample size (all-history): **34**

## Event Outcome

- NFP Outcome: **UP** (Actual 157912.0, Previous 157757.0, Delta +155.0000)
- Direction basis: **vs_previous**

## Probability Table (All-history)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 57.14% | 42.86% | 0.15% | -0.12% | 21 |
| T+7 | 50.0% | 50.0% | 0.12% | 1.03% | 34 |

## Probability Table (Same-direction)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 50.0% | 50.0% | -0.05% | -0.29% | 18 |
| T+7 | 50.0% | 50.0% | 0.12% | 1.05% | 30 |

## Historical Distribution Summary

When NFP was **UP**, QQQ T+1 up probability was **50.0%** (n=18).

When NFP was **UP**, QQQ T+7 up probability was **50.0%** (n=30).

Same-direction T+7 median return: **0.12%**.

For QQQ, historical NFP windows show all-history T+1 up probability of 57.14% and T+7 up probability of 50.0%. When NFP printed Up versus previous, T+1 up probability was 50.0% and T+7 up probability was 50.0% across 18 matched cases. Current classification is Neutral; this remains an educational probability lens, not investment advice.

## Methodology

This page aggregates historical windows for the same event type (NFP) and deduplicates by event date. It reports both all-history probabilities and same-direction probabilities based on event outcome direction (vs previous) for educational use only.
