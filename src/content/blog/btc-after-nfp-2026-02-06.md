- As-of date (T-1): **2026-03-05**
- Freshness age: **27 days**
- Sample size (all-history): **34**

- Direction basis: **vs_previous**

## Probability Table (All-history)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 29.41% | 70.59% | -0.33% | -0.26% | 34 |
| T+7 | 58.82% | 41.18% | 1.0% | 1.55% | 34 |

## Probability Table (Same-direction)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 26.67% | 73.33% | -0.39% | -0.31% | 30 |
| T+7 | 56.67% | 43.33% | 0.81% | 1.51% | 30 |

## Historical Distribution Summary

When NFP was **UP**, BTC T+1 up probability was **26.67%** (n=30).

When NFP was **UP**, BTC T+7 up probability was **56.67%** (n=30).

Same-direction T+7 median return: **0.81%**.

For BTC, historical NFP windows show all-history T+1 up probability of 29.41% and T+7 up probability of 58.82%. When NFP printed Up versus previous, T+1 up probability was 26.67% and T+7 up probability was 56.67% across 30 matched cases. Current classification is Neutral; this remains an educational probability lens, not investment advice.

## Methodology

This page aggregates historical windows for the same event type (NFP) and deduplicates by event date. It reports both all-history probabilities and same-direction probabilities based on event outcome direction (vs previous) for educational use only.
