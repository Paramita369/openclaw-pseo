## Event Snapshot

- Event: **FOMC**
- Asset: **QQQ**
- Event date: **2024-11-08**
- As-of date (T-1): **2026-03-05**
- Freshness age: **482 days**
- Sample size (all-history): **23**

## Event Outcome

- FOMC Outcome: **DOWN** (Actual 4.75, Previous 5.0, Delta -0.2500)
- Direction basis: **vs_previous**

## Probability Table (All-history)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 43.48% | 56.52% | -0.19% | -0.05% | 23 |
| T+7 | 56.52% | 43.48% | 0.88% | 0.27% | 23 |

## Probability Table (Same-direction)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 50.0% | 50.0% | 0.21% | -0.02% | 6 |
| T+7 | 33.33% | 66.67% | -1.24% | -0.66% | 6 |

## Historical Distribution Summary

When FOMC was **DOWN**, QQQ T+1 up probability was **50.0%** (n=6).

When FOMC was **DOWN**, QQQ T+7 up probability was **33.33%** (n=6).

Same-direction T+7 median return: **-1.24%**.

For QQQ, historical FOMC windows show all-history T+1 up probability of 43.48% and T+7 up probability of 56.52%. When FOMC printed Down versus previous, T+1 up probability was 50.0% and T+7 up probability was 33.33% across 6 matched cases. Current classification is Neutral; this remains an educational probability lens, not investment advice.

## Methodology

This page aggregates historical windows for the same event type (FOMC) and deduplicates by event date. It reports both all-history probabilities and same-direction probabilities based on event outcome direction (vs previous) for educational use only.
