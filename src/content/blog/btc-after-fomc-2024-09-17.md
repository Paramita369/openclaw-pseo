- As-of date (T-1): **2026-03-03**
- Freshness age: **532 days**
- Sample size (all-history): **9**

## Event Outcome

- Direction basis: **vs_previous**

## Probability Table (All-history)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 55.56% | 44.44% | 0.35% | 0.19% | 9 |
| T+7 | 55.56% | 44.44% | 0.31% | 1.12% | 9 |

## Probability Table (Same-direction)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 55.56% | 44.44% | 0.35% | 0.19% | 9 |
| T+7 | 55.56% | 44.44% | 0.31% | 1.12% | 9 |

## Historical Distribution Summary

When FOMC was **FLAT**, BTC T+1 up probability was **55.56%** (n=9).

When FOMC was **FLAT**, BTC T+7 up probability was **55.56%** (n=9).

Same-direction T+7 median return: **0.31%**.

For BTC, historical FOMC windows show all-history T+1 up probability of 55.56% and T+7 up probability of 55.56%. When FOMC printed Flat versus previous, T+1 up probability was 55.56% and T+7 up probability was 55.56% across 9 matched cases. Current classification is Neutral; this remains an educational probability lens, not investment advice.

## Methodology

This page aggregates historical windows for the same event type (FOMC) and deduplicates by event date. It reports both all-history probabilities and same-direction probabilities based on event outcome direction (vs previous) for educational use only.
