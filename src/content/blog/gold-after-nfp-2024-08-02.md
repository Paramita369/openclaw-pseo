## Probability Table (All-history)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 0.0% | 100.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0 |
| T+7 | 84.62% | 15.38% | 1.07% | 1.14% | 13 |

## Probability Table (Same-direction)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 0.0% | 100.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0 |
| T+7 | 83.33% | 16.67% | 0.86% | 1.12% | 12 |

## Historical Distribution Summary

When NFP was **UP**, GOLD T+1 up probability was **0.0%** (n=0).

When NFP was **UP**, GOLD T+7 up probability was **83.33%** (n=12).

Same-direction T+7 median return: **0.86%**.

For GOLD, historical NFP windows show all-history T+1 up probability of 0.0% and T+7 up probability of 84.62%. When NFP printed Up versus previous, T+1 up probability was 0.0% and T+7 up probability was 83.33% across 0 matched cases. Current classification is Neutral; this remains an educational probability lens, not investment advice.

## Methodology

This page aggregates historical windows for the same event type (NFP) and deduplicates by event date. It reports both all-history probabilities and same-direction probabilities based on event outcome direction (vs previous) for educational use only.
