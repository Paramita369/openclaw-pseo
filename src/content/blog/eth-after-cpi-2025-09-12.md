- Freshness age: **171 days**
- Sample size (all-history): **14**

## Probability Table (All-history)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 50.0% | 50.0% | -0.22% | -0.52% | 14 |
| T+7 | 42.86% | 57.14% | -0.39% | 0.26% | 14 |

## Probability Table (Same-direction)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 53.85% | 46.15% | 0.66% | -0.36% | 13 |
| T+7 | 46.15% | 53.85% | -0.77% | 0.28% | 13 |

## Historical Distribution Summary

When CPI was **UP**, ETH T+1 up probability was **53.85%** (n=13).

When CPI was **UP**, ETH T+7 up probability was **46.15%** (n=13).

Same-direction T+7 median return: **-0.77%**.

For ETH, historical CPI windows show all-history T+1 up probability of 50.0% and T+7 up probability of 42.86%. When CPI printed Up versus previous, T+1 up probability was 53.85% and T+7 up probability was 46.15% across 13 matched cases. Current classification is Neutral; this remains an educational probability lens, not investment advice.

## Methodology

This page aggregates historical windows for the same event type (CPI) and deduplicates by event date. It reports both all-history probabilities and same-direction probabilities based on event outcome direction (vs previous) for educational use only.
