## Probability Table (All-history)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 66.67% | 33.33% | 0.5% | 0.57% | 21 |
| T+7 | 79.41% | 20.59% | 1.31% | 1.61% | 34 |

## Probability Table (Same-direction)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 61.11% | 38.89% | 0.34% | 0.51% | 18 |
| T+7 | 76.67% | 23.33% | 1.1% | 1.49% | 30 |

## Historical Distribution Summary

When NFP was **UP**, GOLD T+1 up probability was **61.11%** (n=18).

When NFP was **UP**, GOLD T+7 up probability was **76.67%** (n=30).

Same-direction T+7 median return: **1.1%**.

For GOLD, historical NFP windows show all-history T+1 up probability of 66.67% and T+7 up probability of 79.41%. When NFP printed Up versus previous, T+1 up probability was 61.11% and T+7 up probability was 76.67% across 18 matched cases. Current classification is Bullish; this remains an educational probability lens, not investment advice.

## Methodology

This page aggregates historical windows for the same event type (NFP) and deduplicates by event date. It reports both all-history probabilities and same-direction probabilities based on event outcome direction (vs previous) for educational use only.
