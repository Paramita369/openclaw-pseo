- As-of date (T-1): **2026-03-03**
- Freshness age: **151 days**
- Sample size (all-history): **13**

## Probability Table (All-history)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 38.46% | 61.54% | -0.05% | 0.25% | 13 |
| T+7 | 61.54% | 38.46% | 1.54% | 3.29% | 13 |

## Probability Table (Same-direction)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 0.0% | 100.0% | -0.14% | -0.14% | 1 |
| T+7 | 100.0% | 0.0% | 10.31% | 10.31% | 1 |

## Historical Distribution Summary

When NFP was **DOWN**, BTC T+1 up probability was **0.0%** (n=1).

When NFP was **DOWN**, BTC T+7 up probability was **100.0%** (n=1).

Same-direction T+7 median return: **10.31%**.

For BTC, historical NFP windows show all-history T+1 up probability of 38.46% and T+7 up probability of 61.54%. When NFP printed Down versus previous, T+1 up probability was 0.0% and T+7 up probability was 100.0% across 1 matched cases. Current classification is Neutral; this remains an educational probability lens, not investment advice.

## Methodology

This page aggregates historical windows for the same event type (NFP) and deduplicates by event date. It reports both all-history probabilities and same-direction probabilities based on event outcome direction (vs previous) for educational use only.
