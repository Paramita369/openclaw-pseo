## Probability Table (All-history)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 56.41% | 43.59% | 0.34% | 0.3% | 39 |
| T+7 | 78.95% | 21.05% | 1.4% | 1.49% | 38 |

## Probability Table (Same-direction)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 57.89% | 42.11% | 0.42% | 0.35% | 38 |
| T+7 | 78.95% | 21.05% | 1.4% | 1.49% | 38 |

## Historical Distribution Summary

When CPI was **UP**, GOLD T+1 up probability was **57.89%** (n=38).

When CPI was **UP**, GOLD T+7 up probability was **78.95%** (n=38).

Same-direction T+7 median return: **1.4%**.

For GOLD, historical CPI windows show all-history T+1 up probability of 56.41% and T+7 up probability of 78.95%. When CPI printed Up versus previous, T+1 up probability was 57.89% and T+7 up probability was 78.95% across 38 matched cases. Current classification is Bullish; this remains an educational probability lens, not investment advice.

## Methodology

This page aggregates historical windows for the same event type (CPI) and deduplicates by event date. It reports both all-history probabilities and same-direction probabilities based on event outcome direction (vs previous) for educational use only.
