## Event Outcome Interpretation

This event should be read as a distribution problem, not a headline-only trade. GOLD around CPI is best framed through how the release landed higher than the previous release. The current observation shows actual value 326.5880 versus previous 326.0310, a delta of +0.5570. Across the full history, GOLD has a T+7 up probability of 78.95% versus 21.05% down, with a median return of 1.40%. When only matching the same event direction, the T+7 up probability shifts to 78.95% across 38 comparable releases, with a same-direction median of 1.40%. The current release therefore reads as a calibration event inside the median band, not as a high-conviction break. The standing hub thesis for this asset-event pair is: Gold's CPI behavior is primarily a real-yield and USD function; directional conviction increases when CPI surprise and Treasury move point the same way.

## Distribution Position

This window sits in the median band and should be used for calibration rather than conviction. The current T+7 move of 1.06% carries a z-score of -0.18 and a percentile rank of 42.11, which keeps the release inside the central band of observed windows. That is exactly what a strict median norm looks like: neither extreme strength nor extreme weakness, just a normal response range that helps calibrate expectations. The key instruction here is simple: do not overstate what is still a routine macro window.

## Comparison vs Hub Baseline

This comparison stays close to the median band and is best used for calibration. Against the hub baseline for this asset-event pair, the current print is measurable rather than anecdotal. The hub baseline median T+7 return is 1.40% and the current gap is -0.34%. Same-direction probability moves by +0.00% and the same-direction median differs by +0.00%. Those numbers matter because they show where normal variation ends, not because they justify an outsized story. The current regime context also matters: Safe-haven allocation has become more sensitive to policy-cut expectations.

## Failure Modes

The failure mode here is over-reading ordinary data as if it were exceptional. The main failure mode is confusing distribution evidence with certainty. Conflicting moves between yields and USD can produce range-bound noise. Median-band releases often produce the worst decisions when operators insist on finding a dramatic narrative where the distribution is actually telling them to stay measured.

## Execution Relevance

Use this page as an educational operating lens, not a trading instruction. The operational takeaway is calibration, not escalation. The checklist remains Read US10Y real yield change alongside DXY.; Prefer breakout only after direction confirms on both metrics.; Set position size by ATR-based risk budget.. When a page is marked strict median norm, the right move is to compare it against the hub, keep sizing conservative, and do not overstate the evidence.

## Methodology

This page aggregates historical windows for the same event type (CPI) and deduplicates by event date. It reports both all-history probabilities and same-direction probabilities based on event outcome direction (vs previous) for educational use only.
