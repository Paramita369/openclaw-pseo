## Event Snapshot

- Event: **NFP**
- Asset: **ETH**
- Event date: **2025-02-07**
- As-of date (T-1): **2026-03-05**
- Freshness age: **391 days**
- Sample size (all-history): **13**

## Event Outcome

- NFP Outcome: **UP** (Actual 158310.0, Previous 158268.0, Delta +42.0000)
- Direction basis: **vs_previous**

## Probability Table (All-history)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 53.85% | 46.15% | 0.03% | 0.11% | 13 |
| T+7 | 61.54% | 38.46% | 5.12% | 3.32% | 13 |

## Probability Table (Same-direction)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 50.0% | 50.0% | -0.03% | 0.09% | 12 |
| T+7 | 58.33% | 41.67% | 3.01% | 3.07% | 12 |

## Historical Distribution Summary

When NFP was **UP**, ETH T+1 up probability was **50.0%** (n=12).

When NFP was **UP**, ETH T+7 up probability was **58.33%** (n=12).

Same-direction T+7 median return: **3.01%**.

For ETH, historical NFP windows show all-history T+1 up probability of 53.85% and T+7 up probability of 61.54%. When NFP printed Up versus previous, T+1 up probability was 50.0% and T+7 up probability was 58.33% across 12 matched cases. Current classification is Bullish; this remains an educational probability lens, not investment advice.

## Methodology

This page aggregates historical windows for the same event type (NFP) and deduplicates by event date. It reports both all-history probabilities and same-direction probabilities based on event outcome direction (vs previous) for educational use only.
