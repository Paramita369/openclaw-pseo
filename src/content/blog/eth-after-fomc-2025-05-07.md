## Probability Table (All-history)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 55.56% | 44.44% | 1.2% | 1.38% | 9 |
| T+7 | 44.44% | 55.56% | -0.19% | -0.1% | 9 |

## Probability Table (Same-direction)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 55.56% | 44.44% | 1.2% | 1.38% | 9 |
| T+7 | 44.44% | 55.56% | -0.19% | -0.1% | 9 |

## Historical Distribution Summary

When FOMC was **FLAT**, ETH T+1 up probability was **55.56%** (n=9).

When FOMC was **FLAT**, ETH T+7 up probability was **44.44%** (n=9).

Same-direction T+7 median return: **-0.19%**.

For ETH, historical FOMC windows show all-history T+1 up probability of 55.56% and T+7 up probability of 44.44%. When FOMC printed Flat versus previous, T+1 up probability was 55.56% and T+7 up probability was 44.44% across 9 matched cases. Current classification is Neutral; this remains an educational probability lens, not investment advice.

## Methodology

This page aggregates historical windows for the same event type (FOMC) and deduplicates by event date. It reports both all-history probabilities and same-direction probabilities based on event outcome direction (vs previous) for educational use only.
