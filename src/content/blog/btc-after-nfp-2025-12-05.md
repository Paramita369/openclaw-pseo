## Probability Table (All-history)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 38.46% | 61.54% | -0.05% | 0.25% | 13 |
| T+7 | 61.54% | 38.46% | 1.54% | 3.29% | 13 |

## Probability Table (Same-direction)

| Window | P(up) | P(down) | Median return | Mean return | Sample |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| T+1 | 41.67% | 58.33% | -0.03% | 0.28% | 12 |
| T+7 | 58.33% | 41.67% | 1.07% | 2.7% | 12 |

## Historical Distribution Summary

When NFP was **UP**, BTC T+1 up probability was **41.67%** (n=12).

When NFP was **UP**, BTC T+7 up probability was **58.33%** (n=12).

Same-direction T+7 median return: **1.07%**.

For BTC, historical NFP windows show all-history T+1 up probability of 38.46% and T+7 up probability of 61.54%. When NFP printed Up versus previous, T+1 up probability was 41.67% and T+7 up probability was 58.33% across 12 matched cases. Current classification is Neutral; this remains an educational probability lens, not investment advice.

## Methodology

This page aggregates historical windows for the same event type (NFP) and deduplicates by event date. It reports both all-history probabilities and same-direction probabilities based on event outcome direction (vs previous) for educational use only.
